Possible Candidate Keys: ABEF, ACDE, ABCE

      
Reason for ABEF: Use BEF -> C, then B - > D, resulting in ABEF. ABEF cannot be broken down any further.

      
Reason for ACDE: Use CDE - > B, then ACD -> F, resulting in ACDE. ACDE cannot be broken down any further.

  
Reason for ABCE: Use ACD -> F, then B -> D, resulting in ABCE. ABCE cannot be broken down any further.



Possible Candidate Keys: AD
     
     
Functional dependency that can be removed without altering the key: DEG -> H

     	       
Reason: Use AF -> E, then A -> BCF, then D -> GH, resulting in AD. AD cannot be broken down any further. DEG -> H was not needed.
